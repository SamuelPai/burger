# burger
a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and an ORM



still need to finish the part where once I click Devour, it move the burger to the devoured section and update the database. Also need to put node_modules in a .gitignore file. And hide database password.

Need to host on heroku (was having issues with JawsDB)

Need to add css and design
